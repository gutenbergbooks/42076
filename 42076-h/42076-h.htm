<p>In presenting to the public the within collection,
some of which were published originally under the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom-de-plume</i> of "Miriam Lester," I have had to
go into the highways and byways to gather the
children who had strayed into various paths.</p>

<p>Some have been easily found in books of which
they were a part, and I desire to thank the editors
of "The Library of Religious Poetry," the family of
the late Charles Henshaw Dana, of Worcester,
Mass., the Boston "Herald," and others for permission
to use such.</p>

<p>The task of gathering the children who made
their debut within the columns of the Boston
"Transcript," the Eastport "Sentinel," the Washington
"Post," the "Saturday Gazette" (Boston),
and other journals, has been no light task, and some
are still straying beyond my ken.</p>

<p>Among these "Contrasted Songs" I trust that the
reader will find something to which the heart may
respond.</p>

<div class="line">Nor lifts its veil of mystery until we reach the grave!</div>

<h3>THE CHIMES</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">On fair Lake Como's sunny brink,</div>
<div class="line">An ancient monastery stood</div>
<div class="line">Close to the mountain's steep ascent,</div>
<div class="line">As nestling 'neath its snowy hood.</div>
<div class="line">And there a pale young artisan</div>
<div class="line">His cunning plied; a wondrous chime</div>

<div class="line">Pealing at morn and even clear.</div>
</div>

<div class="line">For years he toiled, content if he</div>
<div class="line">At last might frame a chime so sweet</div>
<div class="line">That pilgrims oft would silent pause</div>
<div class="line">To hear the music glad repeat.</div>
<div class="line">Borne o'er the tranquil waters' reach</div>
<div class="line">And bringing swift unto the heart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></div>
<div class="line">Its tones of warning, praise, and love,</div>
<div class="line">That nevermore should then depart.</div>
<div class="line">Such was the thought he wove, and prayed</div>
<div class="line">That his life's work be holy made.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">The day came when that perfect chime</div>
<div class="line">Was placed aloft, its song to wing</div>
<div class="line">Forth o'er the waters' silent reach</div>
<div class="line">And to the convent's roof to bring</div>
<div class="line">The lost and wayworn traveller from</div>
<div class="line">The busy haunts of world and strife,</div>
<div class="line">Back, where the calm of prayer might prove</div>
<div class="line">The guide-post to Eternal life!</div>
<div class="line">Then was the artisan as one</div>
<div class="line">Whose dearest life-work, here, was done.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Not so, howe'er! 'Twas yet to be</div>

<div class="line">Through many a land, in futile search</div>
<div class="line">O'er stony ways where feet should bleed.</div>
<div class="line">Not yet his soul's high guerdon find&mdash;</div>
<div class="line">The prize his hands had placed aloft.</div>
<div class="line">How rarely here on earth we see</div>
<div class="line">Life's morning fill its promise soft.</div>
<div class="line">Not yet was he to find his rest</div>

<div class="line">Only to find his quest in vain,</div>
<div class="line">While yet those bells were ne'er forgot.</div>

<div class="line">The old sweet song rung by his chime</div>

<div class="line">Quickly rose tears in lifted eyes,</div>
<div class="line">Quickly his heart renounced its pain!</div>

<div class="line">Not vain his search! not lost his love!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></div>
<div class="line">He feels once more the old-time throb</div>
<div class="line">Ere cruel foes his prize had ta'en;</div>
<div class="line">No more may they his treasure rob!</div>
<div class="line">His life went forth in one glad cry</div>
<div class="line">Beneath that far-off, alien sky!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">'Twas ended&mdash;all the tender search;</div>
<div class="line">The hours of pain and sleepless toil;</div>
<div class="line">There, where no loved his hand might clasp;</div>
<div class="line">There, on that wild and foreign soil.</div>
<div class="line">But deep within his heart was writ</div>
<div class="line">His purpose pure; his steadfast search.</div>
<div class="line">And lo! his chime still calls to prayer,</div>
<div class="line">And still peals forth from ivied church.</div>
<div class="line">The bells once blessed by saintly hands</div>
<div class="line">Now call, in Limerick, God's commands!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">My story's done&mdash;what need to say</div>
<div class="line">He sleeps as well and sweetly there</div>
<div class="line">Beneath that arch of foreign sky</div>
<div class="line">As in his native land so fair.</div>
<div class="line">He found, ere death had met his feet</div>
<div class="line">The prize he sought with spirit brave,</div>
<div class="line">And finding was content to lie</div>
<div class="line">Afar from Como in his grave.</div>
<div class="line">Love was the goal that led his feet</div>
<div class="line">To peace and deathless calm replete.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">The chimes? Ah, well, perhaps they peal</div>
<div class="line">No less the sweetly that their note</div>
<div class="line">In alien lands the tidings bring;</div>
<div class="line">They still to God their praise devote,</div>
<div class="line">And though their maker no more hears</div>
<div class="line">The liquid music of each tone,</div>
<div class="line">They speak to those whose living needs</div>
<div class="line">Make of the chimes their very own.</div>
<div class="line">Though hand that made is turned to clay,</div>

<div class="line">Every day's returning duties</div>
<div class="line i1">  Found them docile at his side,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">But the day's first, freshest hour</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">There they served with purest offering</div>

<div class="line">I dreamed, and lo! upon the silent earth</div>
<div class="line">(That ever swings, as from its misty birth),</div>
<div class="line">I kinless stood! and all the streams that erst</div>
<div class="line">In joyous measure sang me forth their tale</div>
<div class="line">Sank to a murmur; even while there burst</div>
<div class="line">Upon mine eyes that straightway turned me pale!</div>
<div class="line">I looked and wondered, and I grew as chill</div>
<div class="line">As though their fated touch had froze my blood;</div>
<div class="line">As far beyond that living, green-clad hill,</div>
<div class="line">In breathless awe, mine eyes were turned, I stood</div>
<div class="line">Appalled! Forth from the bosom of the deep</div>
<div class="line">There rose a wondrous chain of towering cliffs,</div>
<div class="line">Clear as the lake upon whose mirror sleep</div>
<div class="line">Light-poised, all tenderly the skiffs;</div>
<div class="line">While rays of light played o'er their polished sides,</div>
<div class="line">As slowly rose and sank they on the tides.</div>
<div class="line">Kissed by the sun they grew; their colors' sheen</div>
<div class="line">Of rose and emerald-touched tips; between</div>
<div class="line">The amethyst deepened to a royal tone</div>
<div class="line">Of purple, and I stood and gazed, alone!</div>
<div class="line">I knew that naught of earth was left save me</div>
<div class="line">To look upon that strange and glorious sea!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></div>
<div class="line">And, as I gazed, wild flames leapt up to seize</div>
<div class="line">The iceberg's glow and melt it to their will:</div>
<div class="line">Naught could their hungry rage of greed appease,</div>
<div class="line">While luridly and sullen burned they still,</div>
<div class="line">What, then, does it portray&mdash;this onslaught fierce</div>
<div class="line">Of flames upon these sunlit cliffs of ice,</div>
<div class="line">If it be not that Evil seeks to pierce</div>
<div class="line">The armor thrown about the soul's device;</div>
<div class="line">The powers that wage unceasing war,</div>
<div class="line">And ever seek to gain what lies afar</div>
<div class="line">Above them! "Souls of just men perfect made,"</div>
<div class="line">"Yield not," I cried, "for here a mortal stands</div>
<div class="line">"Alone and helpless in these alien lands;</div>
<div class="line">"And yet on mortal lips, I know, is laid</div>
<div class="line">"The burden of a knowledge far above</div>
<div class="line">"All thought of human gain or human love!"</div>
<div class="line">And crying thus, I woke, nor ever knew</div>
<div class="line">If to fruition my bright vision grew.</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">I saw a Nation's rise and saw its fall;</div>

<div class="line">How could I realize the utmost span</div>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Julius Eichberg</span>)</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Hushed is the magic of his touch</div>
<div class="line i1">  That waked the soul to joyous praise!</div>
<div class="line">The vibrant strain we loved so much</div>
<div class="line i1">  Still echoes on throughout the days;</div>
<div class="line">Days that had sped in steady round</div>
<div class="line">Thrilled by the songs his bow had bound.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Stilled is the music to our ears.</div>
<div class="line i1">  In higher cycles, we believe,</div>
<div class="line">Brighter than earthly crown appears</div>
<div class="line i1">  His genius, and shall meed receive:</div>
<div class="line">While in a rarer, fuller light,</div>
<div class="line">His touch still wakens to delight.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Then is he not as one who dies</div>
<div class="line i1">  And whose brief day is ended here;</div>
<div class="line">For, in those worlds which Time defies,</div>
<div class="line i1">  His melody grows still more clear;</div>
<div class="line">Then is he not as one whose light</div>
<div class="line">Is darkened by Death's envious night!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Thus while we wear within our thought</div>
<div class="line i1">  The beauty of his god-like art</div>
<div class="line">That here in eager longing sought</div>
<div class="line i1">  To voice the music in his heart,</div>
<div class="line">O bear in mind no truth divine</div>
<div class="line">Of art is lost&mdash;it needs must shine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Across the waste of shipwrecked lives</div>
<div class="line i1">  As o'er the brightest path below;</div>
<div class="line">Where'er its meaning steadfast strives</div>
<div class="line i1">  To sing its measure's stately flow,</div>
<div class="line">For Life is art&mdash;as art is Life&mdash;</div>
<div class="line">And soars above unequal strife!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">He gave to man the measure free</div>
<div class="line i1">  The gods had given to his soul;</div>
<div class="line">And, touched to deeper ecstasy,</div>
<div class="line i1">  Bound Music to his sweet control.</div>
<div class="line">O Artist true! we deem thy death</div>
<div class="line">But entrance into fuller breath.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">But fuller grasp of thy great work;</div>
<div class="line i1">  But deeper draughts from wells divine,</div>
<div class="line">Where disappointment ne'er may lurk,</div>
<div class="line i1">  Where round thy head the glories shine</div>
<div class="line">Which crowns endeavor firm and true,</div>
<div class="line">And gives thee roses&mdash;never rue!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Here do we leave thee with thy brow</div>
<div class="line i1">  Encircled with the roses sweet;</div>
<div class="line">Victory's token, crowning now</div>
<div class="line i1">  Thine art with all our praises meet;</div>
<div class="line">Here do we leave thee, victor still,</div>
<div class="line">For Art bends not to Death's stern will!</div>

<h3>THE NATION WEEPS</h3>

<p class="center smcap"><b>In Memoriam</b></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Wm. McKinley, Sept. 14, 1901.</i>)</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">The nation weeps, while through the stricken land</div>
<div class="line">Stalks the grim specter raised by traitor hand;</div>
<div class="line">And on the air there rises dire lament</div>
<div class="line">For vigil, suffering and life now spent.</div>
<div class="line">Lo! through the tumult comes that voice of trust</div>
<div class="line">From soul of mortal triumphing o'er dust:</div>
<div class="line">"God's will, not ours;" O hero strong</div>
<div class="line">To rise above the thought of burning wrong</div>
<div class="line">Dealt by a dastard's hand! O spirit bright</div>
<div class="line">Seeing, while here, the heavy cross grow light,</div>
<div class="line">"His will be done; His guiding hand my way!"</div>
<div class="line">That heart, yet bound by racking pain, could say.</div>
<div class="line">The nation weeps. Anger and grief uplift</div>
<div class="line">On high their hands; O from this pain to sift</div>
<div class="line">Some grain of comfort and some thought of rest!</div>
<div class="line">Again those tender words, "God knoweth best."</div>
<div class="line">As man, not free from earthly fault was he,</div>
<div class="line">For mortal man may not perfection see;</div>
<div class="line">But yet, as man, he bore full well his part</div>
<div class="line">And freely spent his wealth of brain and heart.</div>
<div class="line">E'en as we think of him the silent land</div>
<div class="line">Draws near, and dimly by his bed there stand</div>
<div class="line">Lincoln and Garfield, now henceforth to be</div>
<div class="line">With him a martyr-trio grand and free.</div>
<div class="line">The nation weeps; O hearts be comforted!</div>
<div class="line">He needs no more your words, so feebly said;</div>
<div class="line">He heeds no more your thoughts of praise or blame,</div>
<div class="line">For he hath won for'er a higher fame.</div>
<div class="line">Soldier of cross and battlefield, his death</div>
<div class="line">Hath taught humanity that fleeting breath</div>
<div class="line">Of mortal glory here is but a slender span,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></div>
<div class="line">And brief, indeed, on earth the life of man!</div>
<div class="line">Dear earth enfold him in your restful arms</div>
<div class="line">And guard him well, though past are all alarms;</div>
<div class="line">E'en though, while now at rest he calmly sleeps,</div>
<div class="line">The nation weeps! The stricken nation weeps!</div>
